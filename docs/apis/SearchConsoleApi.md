# **GetSearchConsolePages**
> void GetSearchConsolePages (int projectId, int range = null, DateTime from = null, DateTime to = null, string sort = null, int page = null, int perPage = null, string output = null, string searchType = null, string filters = null, string dataState = null)

Top Search Console pages (Growth+)

Top Google Search Console landing pages over a date range, ranked by impressions, clicks, ctr or position, paginated. Requires a connected Search Console property (Growth+). X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections. They return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_UPSTREAM (503) when Google Search Console is unavailable or over quota; wait for the number of seconds in Retry-After before retrying. total counts distinct keys available for the range: keys from synced daily rows for stored reads, or up to 25,000 rows from one Google request for live reads. Live responses include truncated: true when that limit is reached. Sorting and pagination apply to the available set.


### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------|------|-------------|-------|
| **projectId** | **int** | Project ID |  |
| **range** | **int** | Number of days to look back (alternative to from/to) | [optional]  |
| **from** | **DateTime** |  | [optional]  |
| **to** | **DateTime** | End of the window. A date-only value such as 2026-09-01 covers that whole day. Pass a full timestamp to end the window earlier. | [optional]  |
| **sort** | **string** |  | [optional] [default to impressions] |
| **page** | **int** |  | [optional] [default to 1] |
| **perPage** | **int** |  | [optional] [default to 20] |
| **output** | **string** | Rectangular output for BI tools (Tableau, Excel, Sheets, ELT). Omit for the default nested JSON. &#39;flat&#39; returns the same metadata plus &#39;columns&#39; and &#39;rows&#39;; &#39;csv&#39; returns those rows as text/csv. Errors are always returned as JSON. | [optional]  |
| **searchType** | **string** | Which search surface to measure. Defaults to web. discover and googleNews carry no query dimension, so Google rejects /search_console/queries for them. | [optional] [default to web] |
| **filters** | **string** | Narrow the query; every entry must match (AND). Send the whole list as one JSON value: filters&#x3D;[{\&quot;dimension\&quot;:\&quot;page\&quot;,\&quot;operator\&quot;:\&quot;contains\&quot;,\&quot;expression\&quot;:\&quot;/blog/\&quot;}] (URL-encoded). An array of objects has no query-parameter form a generated client can produce, so the string is what the official SDKs send; see the SearchConsoleFilters schema for the shape it encodes. includingRegex and excludingRegex take RE2 syntax. At most 10 entries, expression at most 500 characters. The bracket form filters[][dimension]&#x3D;page&amp;filters[][operator]&#x3D;contains&amp;filters[][expression]&#x3D;/blog/ is also accepted. | [optional]  |
| **dataState** | **string** | final (default) counts only rows Google has finalized. all also counts the most recent days, which are still being filled in and will change. | [optional] [default to final] |

Search Console summary (Growth+)

Google Search Console headline totals (impressions, clicks, ctr as a 0..1 fraction, average position) for the project over a date range. Pass dimension=country, device, page, query or searchAppearance to also receive the breakdown aggregated over the range, capped by limit. Requires the project to have a connected Search Console property and the Growth plan or above; otherwise returns ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_NOT_CONNECTED or ERR_PLAN_REQUIRED. X-Search-Console-Backend identifies stored or live reads. Stored reads use synced data without contacting Google. Live reads return ERR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_ACCESS_REVOKED (403) for revoked Google access; reconnect the property in Preferences > Project Settings > Data Connections.
